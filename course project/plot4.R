# Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources

## Filter first for combustion source
## Then filter by coal (there are other non-combustible sources that emit Coal-related particles)

## ANSWER: Emissions from coal combustion-related sources seem to have decreased steadily
##         throughout the years
